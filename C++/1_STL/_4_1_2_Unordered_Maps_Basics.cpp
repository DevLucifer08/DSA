// all the functions of unordered map are same map , except
// 1. inbuilt implementation
// 2. time complexity
// 3. valid keys datatype

// for in-built implementation it uses hash tables instead of trees .
// time complexity of both insertion and accessing is O(1) instead of O(logN) .
// also time complexity of operations like uno_mp.find() , uno_mp.erase() is also O(1) instead of O(logN) .
// because in unordered map elements are not stored in a sorted order .
// datatypes like pair , vector , set are not allowed as keys in unorderd_map because there hash values are not defined .

// The time complexity of this recursive bubble sort algorithm can be analyzed as follows:

// 1. Worst-Case and Average-Case Time Complexity
// For each call to bubble_sort, an iteration over the range [0, n-2] is made, which requires O(n) time. Since bubble_sort is called recursively with n-1 on each subsequent call, it will run approximately n recursive calls. Thus, the total number of comparisons and swaps in the worst case would be:

// O(n) + O(n-1) + O(n-2) + â‹¯ + O(1) = O(n(n-1)/2) = O(n^2)

// Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases.

// 2. Best-Case Time Complexity
// In the best case, if the array is already sorted, the function will still make n-1 recursive calls, each with an O(n) comparison. This recursive implementation does not include an optimization to terminate early if the array is already sorted, so the best-case time complexity remains O(n^2) as well.

// Summary
// Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2)
// Average-case time complexity: O(n^2)
// Best-case time complexity: O(n^2)


// Space Complexity: O(N) auxiliary stack space.
